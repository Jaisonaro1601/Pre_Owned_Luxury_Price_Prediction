This project aims to predict the resale prices of pre-owned luxury fashion items. By leveraging various features such as product type, brand, gender target, seasonality, material, color, seller's country, and seller's performance metrics, the model estimates the resale value of luxury items in the second-hand market.

## Project Overview

Luxury fashion has a thriving second-hand market, where items are often resold at a fraction of their original price. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that provides accurate price estimates for pre-owned luxury fashion items, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
